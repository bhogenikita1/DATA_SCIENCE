4,4,Good but Avarage 😐,"Under 250 it's a value for money keyboard but with the 249 price tag the durability is very poor...Not the durability is the main con also zebronics wireless keyboard's copy version is it.Fully same both are, just a difference here that is wired one's back side battery sell options is sealed and bluetooth one's open so it's a marketing scam by zebronics which i think.if you buy some items of zebronics first see reviews and after think to buy 👍🏻",0.10277777777777779
