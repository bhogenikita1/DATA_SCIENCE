Loved yami gautam's characterSatisfied with the acting and the direction is on another level.And the amazing music which gives you feels üî• and goosebumps.Cinematography is excellent but editing could have been better.How nicely they have put down the real life incidentThe only complain I have with this movie is it is little slow but that's okay it was based on real life incident and not a completely script so that's okay. And the movie could have avoid the melodramatic part.

3, A Masterpiece!!,10,"If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons.
I still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.

5, A perfect tribute our Indian Army,10,"Watched a wartime movie after long time but I must say this one was the best I saw till date. This movie has a no nonsense plot which is entirely focused on the operation that was conducted for URI. The best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary romantic scene. Another best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary talks, cuss words to show the army's behavior, unlike other movies in past where half of the time is use to convince the audience why the operations are necessary. This is a must watch movie for everyone.

9, How's the Film? Okay Sir.,6,"Cinematically flawed yet a praiseworthy attempt to depict an event previously unheard in India's military history. Vicky Kaushal portrays the lead perfectly. Our films do project over emotional or chest thumping Army Officers but Vicky's character is a perfect blend of suppressed emotion coated with a sense of duty. His performance undoubtedly is the greatest asset of the film. Paresh Rawal's character which is based on the lines of NIA chief Ajit Doval keeps the story moving forward. Although I feel certain dialogues like ""Surgical Strike karte hain"" in a closed door meeting with the PM and other top notches or ""Halke halke badhate rahiyega"" could have been better conceived. The Drone selection scene where an intern makes the DRDO chief look like a fool and earn Paresh's compliment ""Son you may have just won us the War"" seemed to be an attempt of comic relief. But only an actor of the calibre of Paresh Rawal could have pulled it off and he did it with a natural candour.There were other plot loopholes. The main mission was made too easy. The strikes were picturesque but the climax lacked nail biting sequences. You are in the enemy's territory furtively and wiping out a selected bunch of dreaded terrorists!!! This is where a Black Hawk Down or a Hurt Locker scores. In the end the resolute of one who decided to overstay to kill the last man standing proved that after all it's Bollywood.Apart from Vicky and Rawal's performance, casting and cinematography deserves a thundering applause. Army thrillers tend to be multistarrers and hence there's always a pressure on the script to accommodate everyone's heroics. Uri is free from this defect and therefore the actors successfully become characters in the plot. Coming to the photogenic part, Uri is visually brilliant. The long range shots of valley, the stretches of Baramulla, the night scenes were wonderfully shot.Overall, definitely a one time watch.

11, This movie doesn't deserve such high ratings..,6,"Great war movies don't glorify bloodshed in wars... what's great about saving private ryan and dunkirk- they don't glorify wars.. The viewer is sane enough to infer who is wrong and who is right.. for an effective storytelling the filmmakers should avoid explicitly telling viewers to side with an army

14, 138 minutes of sheer brilliance!,10,"URI:THE SURGICAL STRIKE is not only one of the best indian war films but one of the best international war films ever made. Debutante Aditya Dhar has done an amazing job with his direction. Mitish Mirchandanis amazing cinematography, stellar vfx (the vfx is mind blowing) and an absolute intergalactic background score and music. All the actors in the film have potrayed and amazing job. A great start to 2019 with URI. DEFINITELY A MUST WATCH.

18, In the Army now,8,"Things happen all over the world. And sometimes movies about those things happening bring them closer to those oblivious to them. For me this is one of those instances. And while there is some melodrama and some patriotic things that I may not fully agree with (look for those things in many Hollywood blockbusters too), the fact that this has no song and dance numbers makes me happy - and enjoy the movie more.My personal preferences aside, the action on display here is really something! The stunt work is very good and if you are faint hearted you may have some issues watching this. Just because certain things have to be taken with a grain of salt, does not make them less appealing. Maybe it will make you look into what actually happened too. Mission accomplished.

19, Thrilling and a Gripping narrative which instills patriotism without getting jingoistic.,7,"------Uri: The Surgical Strike Movie Review: Vicky Kaushals Sterling Performance Adds To The High Josh!Debutant director Aditya Dhar needs to be patted on his back for his well-researched work before transferring his vision on the big screen. In reality, while India and Pakistan's version of this 'surgical strike' have always differed, the film-maker mixes fiction with the facts available in public domain to present a gripping narrative about this covert operation. Without resorting to forced patriotism, the emotions flow naturally in the film.On the flip-side, the film-maker spends a little too much time in building up the drama to establish a personal connect with the characters in the first half of the film. This tends to slow down the pace of the narrative leaving you a bit dry as you eagerly wait for the action to begin.Vicky Kaushal is in a terrific form as the man in uniform and proves yet again why he is one of the best from the current crop of Gen-X actors.Mohit Raina (Mahadev-shiv) makes an impressive transition to the big screen and has a commendable screen presence.Yami Gautam's character begins on an interesting note. However, Aditya Dhar fails to explore more sides to it....yami's role is dull..!!Cinematography is neat and leaves you at the edge of your seats especially in the last 20 minutes of the film.Stefan Richter's action sequences are top-notch and well-choreographed.Every time, Vicky Kaushal's Vihaan screams, 'How's the Josh?' to his battalion of soldiers, you feel the adrenaline rush as you hear, 'Very high, Sir.'Uri manages to make your heart swell with pride for the armed forces who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the nation.

22, The spirit was there but not execution,4,"Well it showed many flaws only the emotional drama was bang on targetParesh Rawal is generally a very good actor but in this film..neither his way of speaking nor his attitude convinced me of his high rank portrayed in this movieA high ranking official of the Army (the lady officer) who is an active member of surgical strike plan...would never be sent to someone home as a nurse.. do you think that is believable?The Garood ..that flying surveillance bird which ..could see everything..but it missed the Pakistani boy approaching the window....If i keep on going i can name another 100 flaws...some tactical terms will like ""handler"" and a few others will not really play the trick to convince the viewer of such a skillful operation...Poor execution and flaws pulled it down
